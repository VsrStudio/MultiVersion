## MultiVersion Recontinued

This is a recontinued version of the MultiVersion plugin by AkmalFairuz

## Supported Protocols

- 1.20.30 (729)
- 1.20.40 (748)
- 1.20.50 (766)

Please note that Microsoft/Mojang made changes in Minecraft Multiplayer which caused everyone to be unable to connect to servers with pre-1.20 client so I do not have any plans to support versions below 1.20 for now

**NOTE: This plugin is not guaranteed to work properly**
